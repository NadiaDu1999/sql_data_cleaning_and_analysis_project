# 💼 Job Market SQL Analysis – Data Cleaning & Insights

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **SQL data cleaning, transformation, and analysis pipeline** using real-world job market data. The goal is to transform messy job listings into a structured analytics-ready dataset and extract meaningful insights about **skills demand, salaries, company size, and hiring trends**.

## 📝 Data Cleaning Processes

- 1. Check duplicate rows
- 2. Removing irrelevant values from a column
- 3. Standardizing the data
- 4. Create new columns 
- 5. Text-to-numeric transformation (post_date)
- 6. Remove unnecessary columns
- 7. Missing value imputation
- 8. Relocate columns
 
## ⚙️ SQL Techniques & Data Engineering

This project used both core and advanced SQL to clean, transform, and model job market data. Core operations such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, ALTER TABLE, and UPDATE were used to explore and restructure the dataset. 

More advanced logic was implemented using CASE WHEN statements to classify job seniority, standardise salary bands, categorise company size and work type, and convert unstructured text into structured analytical fields. Also, to enable deeper insights, I performed feature engineering using one-hot encoding, creating binary (0/1) columns for technical skills such as SQL, Python, Power BI, AWS, Excel, Tableau, R, Java, and ML.

## 📊 Key Business & Market Questions

This project answers real-world labour market and hiring questions, including:
- How does skill demand vary by company size?
- What are the top 3 skills required across all jobs?
- What is the distribution of jobs by work mode (Remote, Hybrid, On-site)?
- What is the average, min, max salary by seniority level?
- Do certain company types prefer certain seniorities or skills?

## 🌱 Insight from Analysis

✨ R, Python, and SQL are the top three most in-demand skills across all job listings.

✨ Companies with fewer than 5,000 employees post the highest number of job openings.

✨ R is the most requested skill for senior-level positions.

✨ On-site roles offer the highest minimum, maximum, and average salaries, followed by hybrid, then remote roles.

✨ Data Engineers earn the highest salaries, followed by Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Analysts.
